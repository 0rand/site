            <h4>More on StakeTree</h4>
            <p>Hi everyone. <a href="https://twitter.com/nieldlr" target="_blank">Niel de la Rouviere</a> here. StakeTree is just starting out. I believe that to grow the crypto ecosystem
            (and hopefully much more in the future!) we need better ways to fund projects & creators. ICOs are all the rage, but sometimes it just doesn't make
            sense for all that capital to be tied up, especially if your dapp doesn't need a token yet.</p>
            <p>Using smart contracts on Ethereum, creators & funders can back projects with no intermediaries, fees and instant settlement.</p>
            <p>There's lots more planned for StakeTree:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Creating a simple UI</strong> for funders & creators to fund & withdraw from the contracts.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop funding tiers</strong>. This is where creators can reward dedicated backers with special rewards/access. Think tiers like Kickstarter & Patreon.</li> 
                <li><strong>Fund contracts with any ERC-20 token.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tokenization for funders</strong>. When the creator withdraws ether, it mints tokens for the current stakers. These tokens can then be used for many things: voting, curation, special access, discounts and more. The creativity of the creator is the limit here.</li>
                <li><strong>Create funding buckets</strong>. For example fund many Ethereum dev related projects using a single payment.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I need your help to build StakeTree. In true dogfooding fashion, I'll be funding StakeTree using a staketree contract myself. The MVP is almost done. Signup to the mailing list to get updates (or follow development on <a href="https://github.com/staketree">Github</a>):</p>
